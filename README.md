# Social Network API

## Description

This project implements a RESTful API for a social network application where users can post their thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and manage a friends list. Built with Node.js and Express, this API utilizes MongoDB with Mongoose ODM to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently. This backend system demonstrates the power of NoSQL databases in managing dynamic schemas and offers extensive API routes for managing users, thoughts, and reactions.
